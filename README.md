# Hi, I'm Teddy Gyabaah 👋

Here on Github I build **AI agents, automation systems and Saas Products** that businesses and consumers actually use in production.

My focus: **workflow automation, voice AI, and RAG systems** that deliver measurable ROI. I build solutions that help companies move from AI experimentation to real-world deployment, combining product strategy with hands-on engineering to ship solutions that are usable, compliant, and aligned with business goals.

## What I Work On

* 🤖 **AI & Voice Agents**: Customer service bots, lead qualification, conversational interfaces that feel natural
* ⚙️ **Workflow Automation**: N8N pipelines, intelligent data processing, multi-agent orchestration
* 🎯 **RAG Applications**: Enterprise knowledge bases, document intelligence, chat-with-your-data systems
* 🔧 **Production patterns**: Agent design, error handling, monitoring, compliance (GDPR/HIPAA)

## About Me

* 🎯 Product Manager @ Microsoft & AI Engineer in my own time at the intersection of strategy and implementation
* 🏗️ Built and scaled intelligent systems across industries
* 💼 I help businesses move from **AI experimentation → production deployment**.
* 🛠️ Tech stack: LLMs (OpenAI, Claude, Azure), LangChain, N8N, Voiceflow, ElevenLabs, Python, FastAPI, Vector DBs, Azure/GCP
